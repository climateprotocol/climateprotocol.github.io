We give CO2 a value or rather a fee to pay as _Money Makes the World_

The idea is to make everything more expensive which produces CO2 while production or usage.  
This will lead people to buy stuff producing less CO2.

The same works also for companies. They will also try to produce less expensive CO2.

The average money gained from the taxes is given directly back to the consumer.
That means you can even earn money if you produce less CO2.

So in the End only the people producing more CO2 than the average lose money.

# Example: European Union

Its approach is the emission trading which works using a maximum produced amount of CO2.  
The Problem is just that too much is allowed. According to that the price is pretty low.

This could have been a perfect way to fight the climate change without complex policies. Everything would have worked itself.

But sadly the price per ton CO2 is currently only at **25 â‚¬**  
In my opinion it makes no sense that the countries now individually introduce a own CO2 tax instead of fixing the existing one.
