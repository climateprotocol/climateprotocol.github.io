Hi, this is my blog I created out of frustration that not enough is done against the climate change.  
I hope this blog can motivate people to think of Climate Change as a serious topic.

You can find the page source code at [Github](https://github.com/climateprotocol/climateprotocol.github.io)

Feel free to post ideas, feedback or what ever comes into your mind there!

You can also contact me via E-mail <climateprotocol@protonmail.com>

This page is created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
